### Walkthrough
1. Observe the low and short platforms. This shows that this is a light rail stop as heavy rail uses high level platforms. Also, the stanchions (the things holding up the overhead wires) look very different on heavy rail.
2. Observe the two tracks merging into one. There are only 3 sections of single track light rail in Sydney: Central (Grand Concourse), Dulwich Hill and under Kissing Point Rd in Carlingford.
3. Both Central and Dulwich Hill can be discounted as they only have 1 platform, whereas 2 are shown in the photo. Therefore, we can conclude Carlingford is shown in the photo.

Also, you can see the platforms are very much still under construction. Assuming the photo was taken recently (there is no EXIF data so you can't be sure), this also narrows it down to Carlingford as Central (light rail stop) opened in 1997 and Dulwich Hill opened in 2014.
